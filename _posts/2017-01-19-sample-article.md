# Homeowner’s insurance 101 and best options #

Buying a home is a dream come true for most of us. It’s a huge commitment and in most cases, the biggest financial investment that we make in our lifetime. The home buying experience can be both exciting and daunting at the same time. Once you have researched the property, the neighborhood and the financing options you are left with just one more thing – insurance!  

Home insurance is not only necessary for you to protect yourself from a loss, but is also mandatorily required by lenders who finance the mortgage. You even have to include the lender in the insurance policy itself and are required to keep the policy active for as long as the mortgage lasts.   

## What losses does the policy cover? ##

The most basic coverage is for the dwelling or the house itself and any attached fixtures like plumbing, wiring and permanently installed AC units. Usually, there is additional coverage for various things like:  

> - Other structures like fences, detached garages, sheds and so on
> - Your personal property including clothes, electronics, furniture etc.
> - Expenses for a hotel stay or something similar for the duration of the repairs in case your house is damaged
> - Personal liability and medical coverage which covers you against legal and medical damages in case someone is hurt on your property or incurs some damage
